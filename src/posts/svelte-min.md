Svelte is a great way to build front-ends without too much overhead.
I've put together a bare-bones starter project that's useful for quickly spinning up HTML+Javascript for anything from coding tutorials to real projects.

Just run:

```bash
npx degit jakebrown/svelte-min new-project
cd new-project
npm run dev
```

Check the soure code on [GitHub](https://github.com/JakeBrown/svelte-min) to see what it includes.
